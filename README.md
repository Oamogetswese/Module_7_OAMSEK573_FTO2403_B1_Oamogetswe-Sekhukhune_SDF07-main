# [SDF07] Project: CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

Welcome to the CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile project, where you'll get hands-on experience applying CSS layout concepts. In this project, we will have fun recreating a simplified version of an Instagram user profile page. You aim to practice using CSS for styling and layout to create a visually appealing and responsive web page.
